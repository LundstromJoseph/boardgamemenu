## What to contribute?

Any contributions are welcome. If you have a feature you think would be good the for project feel free to suggest it in Issues. If you don't have any ideas but want to contribute anyway look for issues that are accepted in GitHub.

## How to contribute?

Choose an issue, fork the repo and then make a PR back to this repo. Make sure tests pass and if it's a new feature add tests for it as well.
